## Code Block Time

As we can now decipher the time spent by our functions at the code block level ...

Keep a-track of your coding time.

Setting the time wrapper for the execution of a function ...

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% highlight html linenos %}
console.time(programTimer,"Square It Time"); 
var programTimer; {
    Execute Function Inside This Code Block
}
console.timeEnd(programTimer,"Square It Time");
{% endhighlight %}
{% endraw %}
```

## Last Subtitle

Place the introducing line of text ie.) the 'tagline' here ...

**Note**. The above synopsis was derived from an article written by Blank [[2](#BLANK){:.red}].

### Raw Code Block

```liquid
{% raw %}
Enjoy the successful output!
{% endraw %}
```
