## Social Engineering and Pain Relief

Welcome! This is the Social Engineering page of the **Carbon Free Footprint** project.

## Cannabis and Society

**Fact**. Americans are fundamentally wired from birth to respond to the Cannabis plant.

Cannabis helps regulate the Human Endocannabinoid System, or [ECS](https://bit.ly/HumanEndocannabinoidSystem){:title='Click to Visit the Landing page for the Human Endocannabinoid System video at YouTube'}{:target='_blank'} by adhering to receptors between each neuron of the brain.

Through a special type of adherance to the receptors located at the apex of the dendrite of the neuron, Cannabis plant phytocannabinoids help regulate the neurotransmitters responsible for the accentuated feelings of anxiety, remorse, and fear that are caused by perceptions of unreal manifestations of reality experienced by the over-reactive members of our societal niches.

One "knee-jerk" reaction to the Cannabis plant is experienced by Prohibitionists set by the **Social Engineering** efforts of the past that epigenetically and politically pass on from one generation to the next an abject fear of the natural medicines, terpenes, and cannabinoids produced by the plant.

That is why, under the auspicion of native, familial - tribal protectionism and groupthink, even after thirteen (13) successive changes of political White House administrations from Roosevelt to Trump we still have the plant technically illegal under a Federal statute enacted by a congress-past chock full of recipients of "Big Pharma", "Big Timber", and "Big Oil" political donations.

Never has such a detrimental hoax been socially engineered upon the American people to direct American money to targets conducive to losing 20,000 "guinea pig" lives per annum when contrasted with the ZERO fatalities of [Cannabinoid](https://youtu.be/CUEvzNBTPxc){:title='Click to Visit the Landing page for the ECS - Human Endocannabinoid System video at YouTube'}{:target='_blank'} stashes past.

Why then is Cannabis still illegal to grow in America, whereas the Tobacco plant is not?

Look no further than through the lens of the last [Cook Election Report](http://cookpolitical.com/story/10201){:title='Click to Review the General Election of November 2016 Through The Lens of The Cook Report'}{:target='_blank'} for the General Election of November 2016 that foresaw the rise of President Trump and the demise of legal grows for patients throughout the Great State of Arizona.

In President Trump's own words, an easily swayed chunk of the populace spread across many Arizonan counties that in effect hurridly threw the "baby out with the bathwater" at the beheast of their GOP "masters" by voting down #RecMj in Az in Nov #2016 to the detriment of all unfortunate medical patients that reside within (25) miles of a branch of the rapacious medical marijuana dispensary tax machine of Arizona.

If you would like to help us overturn this archaic and detrimental (25) mile rule for medical patients in Arizona, then please give generously to the Medical Marijuana Initiative of North America - International Limited.

Your donation will help spur change at the State Legislature and to help fund future initiatives that may then be placed at the foot of the voters of Arizona's thirteen (13) counties for ultimate decision.

Thank you for your financial support of our initiative.

If you would like to join our initiative, please provide your contact information when donating online via our safe donation portal at the [Cash me app by Square Up](https://cash.me/MMINAIL){:title='Click to Visit the Landing page for the Cash me app by Square Up'}{:target='_blank'}
